//! Shared machinery for the "named required tests" gates.
//!
//! A whole family of shell gates share one shape: a list of test names that
//! must appear in a cargo test log, plus a self-test that stages a fake log
//! (all names present -> pass; first name removed -> fail). This module holds
//! that shape once so each ported gate is a name list and a subject string.
