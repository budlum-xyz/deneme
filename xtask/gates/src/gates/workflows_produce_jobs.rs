//! A workflow that parses but produces no jobs is a check that does not exist.
//!
//! # The failure this closes
//!
//! `extra-tooling.yml` ran zero jobs on every push for an unknown stretch, and
//! the header of that file records what happened: a `slsa-provenance` job
//! called a reusable workflow from `steps[].uses`. Reusable workflows are only
//! valid at job level, so GitHub rejected the whole file. Every run finished
//! instantly as a failure with no jobs, and the other five jobs in the file,
//! `cargo-auditable`, `cargo-audit`, dead-dependency detection, taplo and
//! Kani, ran not at all.
//!
//! Nothing caught it. `actionlint` passes the file locally; the construct is
//! syntactically fine and only invalid in that position.
//! `check-gates-are-wired.sh` confirms a script is *named* by some workflow,
//! which was true the entire time. Six weeks of "the gate is wired" and the
//! gate was not running.
//!
//! So the question this asks is not "does the YAML parse" but "would this
//! file produce work".
//!
//! # What is checked
//!
//! Statically, without calling GitHub:
//!
//! 1. Every workflow declares at least one job.
//! 2. No job uses a reusable workflow from inside `steps[].uses`. That is the
//!    exact construct that killed the file, and it is invalid anywhere except
//!    `jobs.<id>.uses`.
//! 3. A job with neither `steps` nor `uses` produces nothing.
//! 4. Every `steps[].uses` action reference is pinned to a 40-character commit
//!    SHA. A tag is mutable, and a mutable reference in a job that can read
//!    the repository is the supply-chain shape the `TanStack` compromise used.
//!
//! The parser is deliberately small. A full YAML implementation would be a
//! dependency, and this crate has none by choice: it decides what reaches
//! `main`, so every crate it pulls in widens that trust boundary. What is
//! needed here is the indentation structure of a known file shape, which is
//! reachable by reading lines.
