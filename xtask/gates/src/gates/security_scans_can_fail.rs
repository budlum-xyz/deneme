//! A security scan that cannot fail is a report, and it is filed as a gate.
//!
//! # What was measured
//!
//! Twenty-four places across the workflows soften a check: `continue-on-error`
//! on a job or step, or `|| true` on the command that does the work. Some are
//! right. A benchmark that prints a number, a size report, a teardown step
//! that must run whatever happened before it: none of those should stop a
//! merge.
//!
//! Five are not right, and they are all in the two files named for security:
//!
//!   zizmor          GitHub Actions static analysis, the tool that finds the
//!                   pwn-request and cache-poisoning shapes
//!   cargo-hack      feature matrix, which is how a feature combination that
//!                   does not compile reaches main
//!   mutants         mutation testing, the only check that measures whether
//!                   the tests would notice a change
//!   supply-chain    publisher visibility
//!   tsan            `ThreadSanitizer`, data race detection
//!
//! `tsan` carries both softeners at once: `continue-on-error: true` on the job
//! and `|| true` on the command. It cannot fail under any circumstance, and it
//! has no canary, so nothing distinguishes "no data races" from "the binary
//! never ran".
//!
//! For a chain, a data race is not a flaky test. Two nodes disagreeing about
//! state because of one is a fork.
//!
//! # What this gate does, and what it does not
//!
//! It does not demand every softener be removed. Some scans are genuinely
//! informational and some are too slow or too noisy to block on today, and
//! saying otherwise would be a rule nobody could follow.
//!
//! It demands that each one is *listed*, with a reason, in this file. A
//! softener that appears in a workflow and not here fails, and an entry here
//! matching no softener fails too, so the list cannot outlive what it
//! describes. That is the same shape as `PENDING_REVIEW` in the capability
//! gate, for the same reason: a suppression nobody can audit is worse than the
//! finding it hides.
