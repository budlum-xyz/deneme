//! Repository gates, in Rust.
//!
//! # Why this crate exists
//!
//! The gates were shell. Eighteen thousand lines of it across seventy-four
//! `scripts/check-*.sh`, each one deciding whether a commit is allowed onto
//! `main`. That places them inside the trust boundary, and shell is a poor
//! language to put there:
//!
//!   * A misspelt variable is an empty string, not an error, so a check can
//!     silently examine nothing and report OK. `set -u` catches the unset
//!     case and not the misspelt-but-assigned one.
//!   * `grep -q` answers "does this text appear", which is the wrong question
//!     often enough that it let a wrongly scaled rate and a stale factor
//!     through two separate gates on this branch alone. Both were found by
//!     recomputing outside the gate, not by the gate.
//!   * There is no type between a path, a count and a label, so a gate that
//!     compares the wrong two things compiles and runs.
//!   * The canaries were themselves shell, so a broken canary and a working
//!     one look the same from the outside.
//!
//! Rust removes the first and third by construction, and makes the second a
//! matter of writing the arithmetic out rather than grepping for its answer.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! One binary, one gate per module, each exposing `run` and `self_test`.
//! Both return `Result<String, String>`: the `Ok` side is what a passing gate
//! prints, the `Err` side is the finding. Nothing calls `process::exit` from
//! inside a gate, so a gate can be called from a test.
//!
//! # Migration
//!
//! The shell gates are being replaced one at a time, not in a single sweep. A
//! gate moves when its Rust version reproduces every canary the shell version
//! had, which is checked by `--self-test`. Until a gate has moved, its shell
//! script stays wired and authoritative; a half-ported gate that runs in
//! neither language would be worse than the shell it replaced.
