#
# A manifest must say whether its bytes are ciphertext, and the saying must be
# part of what the id commits to.
#
# Why this gate exists.
#
# `src/storage/` held no encryption of any kind and no statement about it
# either. Every manifest was silent, so every reader resolved the silence for
# itself: an operator could not tell whether the shard it served was readable
# content, and a client whose decrypt failed could not tell a wrong key from a
# corrupt shard.
#
# The chain cannot encrypt anything. It holds no bytes. What it can do is
# carry the uploader's statement and make it immutable, and the only way to
# make it immutable is to put it inside `manifest_id`. Left outside, the claim
# is rewritable under a stable id: register as `ClientSide`, serve a manifest
# reading `Plaintext` at the same id, and every later reader concludes the
# bytes were never protected. That is the whole reason the binding, and not
# just the field, is what this gate watches.
#
# The measured shapes this refuses:
#
#   1. The field exists but `manifest_id_from_parts` never reads it. The
#      declaration is then decorative: two manifests share an id and disagree
#      about whether the content is private, and first-writer-wins picks one.
#   2. The commitment tag is derived from the enum's declaration order rather
#      than written out, so reordering variants silently changes every
#      manifest id ever computed.
#   3. `Plaintext` stops being the default, so every manifest written before
#      the field deserializes into a privacy claim nobody made.
#   4. A key, key id, wrapped key or nonce is added to the declaration, which
#      publishes key material on a public chain.
#
# What this gate does not check: that anything was actually encrypted. Nothing
# on chain can check that, and a gate claiming to would be reporting a
# guarantee the system does not have. The declaration is a published statement
# by the uploader, verifiable only in the one arithmetic sense the size floor
# covers.
