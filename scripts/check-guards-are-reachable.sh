# check-guards-are-reachable.sh, a refusal nothing calls is a comment.
#
# Three defects of the same shape have now been found by hand, and each was
# correct code that never ran:
#
#   * `objects_needing_repair` computed the repair band and no sweep read it,
#     so the effective repair window was unbounded while every published
#     durability figure assumed one that existed.
#   * `validate_mainnet_disk_policy` refused plaintext BLS and post-quantum
#     keys on mainnet, and no load path called it.
#   * `check_content_may_be_public` refused to let paid content register in
#     the public deduplicated class. Its doc comment said "called on the
#     declaration path". Nothing called it, so paid content registered as
#     plaintext, and a plaintext ContentId is the hash of the bytes: anyone
#     holding a candidate file could confirm it was the listed asset.
#
# All three passed review, passed their own tests, and passed CI. What they
# have in common is not a bug in the logic but a missing edge in the call
# graph, and nothing in this repository was looking for that.
#
# This gate counts them. Every `pub fn` whose name begins check/verify/
# validate/require/enforce/assert/reject/refuse/deny/guard is a refusal by
# its own naming, and a refusal reachable only from tests protects the tests.
#
# It is a ratchet rather than a wall. Twenty exist today; that is the
# baseline, and it may only go down. Wiring one up, or moving it into a
# module that honestly declares `WIRING: unwired`, lowers the number. Adding
# a twenty-first fails the run that adds it, which is the moment it costs
# nothing to fix.
#
# Deliberately not a hard zero. Twenty modules cannot be wired in one change
# without a diff nobody can review, and a gate that demands that gets turned
# off. A number that can only fall gets paid down.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-guards-are-reachable.sh              # gate
#   bash scripts/check-guards-are-reachable.sh --self-test  # canary
