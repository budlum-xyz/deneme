# check-storage-penalties-are-enforced.sh
#
# A penalty recorded and never checked is not a penalty.
#
# Why this gate exists.
#
# Two rules were added to the storage layer, and both have the same failure
# mode: the data can exist, the tests can pass, and nothing on the path an
# operator actually walks ever consults it.
#
#   * An operator that misses a challenge sits out six hours. The record lives
#     in `StorageRegistry.operator_cooldowns`; the check has to happen in
#     `open_storage_deal_with_escrow`, because that is the layer that knows
#     wall time. A cooldown written and never read is a map that costs every
#     node storage and protects nobody.
#
#   * A mobile operator may hold a second or third copy and never the first.
#     The class lives in `StorageRegistry.operator_classes`; the check belongs
#     in `open_deal`, next to the other reasons a deal is refused.
#
# This is the `capability-modules-are-wired` problem in miniature, and it has
# bitten this tree before: `mobile_self.rs` held the rule that critical
# content needs a paid replica, had tests, and was never called.
#
# What the gate checks.
#
#   1. The cooldown is in seconds, not epochs. An epoch here is
#      `slot_duration_secs * epoch_length_slots`, both governance parameters,
#      so a punishment written as "67 epochs" silently becomes four hours or
#      twelve the next time either is tuned.
#   2. It really is six hours.
#   3. `begin_operator_cooldown` extends and never shortens. A replayed or
#      reordered failure carrying an older timestamp must not pull the
#      deadline in.
#   4. There is a prune. The map is hashed into the state root, so without one
#      it grows with every failure the network ever saw.
#   5. Both maps reach `root()`. They decide who may open a deal, so two nodes
#      disagreeing about them would accept different blocks.
#   6. The cooldown is enforced where wall time is known.
#   7. The primary-replica rule is enforced in `open_deal`.
#   8. The named regressions exist and are real `#[test]` functions.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-storage-penalties-are-enforced.sh
