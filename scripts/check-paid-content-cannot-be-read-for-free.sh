#
# Pollen sells permission. B.U.D. serves bytes. They were built separately and
# nothing joined them, so the same object could be listed for sale here and
# fetched from storage by anyone who knew its `manifest_id`, with the second
# path asking no questions. Paying was optional in the only sense that counts.
#
# Three properties keep that closed, and each is invisible in review:
#
#   1. the read path consults the binding at all. A refactor that drops the
#      `authorize_content_read` call leaves every test passing, because the
#      tests that would catch it are the ones nobody writes for a check that
#      used to be there;
#   2. protected content can never be declared public. The public class is
#      the deduplicated one, and deduplication keys on content, so a listed
#      asset in it can be confirmed by anyone who guesses the bytes, or have
#      a missing field brute-forced. That is confirmation-of-a-file and
#      learn-the-remaining-information, and paid data is their target;
#   3. the binding is one-way. An unbind would let an owner take payment and
#      then release the bytes into the free path, which is the same as not
#      having sold anything.
#

# `validate_ai_read_ref` safe: a request with no Pollen prefix cannot reach
# protected bytes because it cannot reach any bytes.
#
