# check-containment-defaults.sh, a gate that is off by default must stay off
# by default, and the path that reaches it must actually consult it.
#
# From the containment-first directive: the protection is not that a
# vulnerability is hidden, it is that it cannot be triggered. Three mechanisms
# carry that here, a feature closed until a threshold is proven, a default
# that refuses on uncertainty, and structural isolation. All three fail the
# same way: the flag stays in the source, reads correctly in review, and the
# code path that matters never looks at it.
#
# That is not hypothetical. Both halves happened at once:
#
#   * bud-vm's `decode_instruction` hard-coded `MainnetActivation::full()`,
#     which set every staged-rollout flag true and left
#     `MainnetActivation::default()` unreachable from the only caller that
#     consults it. `verify_merkle_enabled: false` and
#     `verify_inference_enabled: false` became dead code.
#
#   * `ContractCall` runs bytecode straight out of `tx.data` through
#     `ZkVmExecutor::execute_bytecode`, which passed `mainnet = false` and so
#     skipped `decode_for_mainnet` entirely. The gate would not have applied to
#     the one input an attacker chooses even if it had been correct.
#
# And the test meant to catch it asserted `is_err() || gas_used > 0`, which is
# true of every possible outcome.
#
# This gate reads the source and checks the three things that were wrong:
#
#   1. The staged-rollout defaults are still closed.
#   2. The VM decodes against `default()`, not `full()`.
#   3. The contract-execution entry point requests gated decoding.
#
# It cannot prove a gate is *correct* - only that it is still wired the way it
# was argued. That is the property that decayed.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-containment-defaults.sh              # gate
#   bash scripts/check-containment-defaults.sh --self-test  # canary
