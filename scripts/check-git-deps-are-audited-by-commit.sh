#
# A git dependency's version number is not evidence about its contents.
#
# Why this gate exists.
#
# Twenty-three packages in the root lockfile come from a git revision rather
# than a registry, all of them the pinned rust-libp2p tree. For a registry
# crate, `version = "0.50.0"` names an immutable published artefact, and every
# scanner in the repository reasons from that name: cargo-audit, cargo-deny,
# osv-scanner and grype all match advisories against `name` plus `version`.
#
# For a git dependency the same field is whatever the manifest happened to say
# at that commit, and it does not move when the code does. Measured on the
# pinned tree:
#
#   commit 8541b83b  gossipsub Cargo.toml version = 0.50.0  backoff.rs has no
#                    checked_add: the CVE-2026-33040 insertion-side overflow
#                    is present
#   commit a7d59cbf  gossipsub Cargo.toml version = 0.50.0  adds the insertion
#                    checked_add, CHANGELOG opens 0.49.3
#   commit 5d47d9d5  gossipsub Cargo.toml version = 0.50.0  adds the heartbeat
#                    checked_add, CHANGELOG opens 0.49.4
#
# Three different security postures, one version string. A scanner told
# "libp2p-gossipsub 0.50.0" cannot distinguish them, and 0.50.0 is not a
# published crates.io release, so no advisory range covers it either. Both
# CVEs are in fact patched at the pinned revision, which is the point: the
# repository is safe here by luck of when the pin was taken, and nothing in
# CI would have said otherwise had it been taken a fortnight earlier.
#
# cargo-vet does not close this. Its own documentation classifies git
# dependencies as non-auditable, so the 437-package audit count excludes all
# twenty-three. Cargo does not write a checksum for git sources into the
# lockfile either, so there is no artefact digest to compare against.
#
# What the gate checks.
#
# Every distinct git revision in a lockfile must be recorded in
# .github/git-dep-audit.toml with:
#
#   * the revision, byte-identical to the lockfile
#   * an upstream-commit date, so a reviewer can ask what landed after it
#   * the specific advisories checked at that revision and the file and symbol
#     that carries each fix
#
# The gate does not fetch anything. A network call at gate time would make the
# result depend on a third party's uptime and on whatever the branch says
# today, which is the same mistake as trusting a checksum served next to the
# artefact it describes. What is checked is that a human wrote down what they
# verified and that the revision they verified is the revision being built.
#
# The gate fails when a lockfile carries a git revision the file does not
# mention, and when the file mentions a revision no lockfile uses. The second
# direction matters: a stale entry is how a record stops describing the build.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-git-deps-are-audited-by-commit.sh              # gate
#   bash scripts/check-git-deps-are-audited-by-commit.sh --self-test  # canary
