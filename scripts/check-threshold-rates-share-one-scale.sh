# check-threshold-rates-share-one-scale.sh
#
# A storage decision compares two rates. Only their ratio matters, so any
# common scale cancels, and that is exactly what makes the scale dangerous:
# applying it to one rate and not the other changes every threshold by the
# scale factor and changes nothing that looks wrong.
#
# This happened. `living_threshold.rs` carries a disk rate and a processor
# rate, both below one picodollar, both therefore multiplied by 1e6 to survive
# integer arithmetic. The first version multiplied the processor rate by 1e9
# instead, and the described-content threshold read 0.4 reads per half-life
# where the measurement says 418. Every test still passed, because the tests
# compared thresholds against each other and both sides moved together. It was
# caught by recomputing the same arithmetic outside Rust, not by the suite.
#
# So the rule is that the rates a threshold divides must be pinned to values
# an independent calculation reproduces, and the thresholds they produce must
# be pinned too.
#
# What the gate checks.
#
#   1. The module states, in its own comment, what each rate means in physical
#      units. A number whose unit lives only in the author's head cannot be
#      rechecked by the next person.
#   2. The rates are pinned to the values this project measured: 0.29 $/TB per
#      month of owned disk and 0.0025 $/hour of processor. Both are carried at
#      the same 1e6 scale, which is what makes 403 and 694 the right integers.
#   3. A test asserts the ordering of two thresholds that differ by a known
#      factor, so a scale applied to one side alone breaks it.
#   4. No floating point anywhere in the module. This decides whether bytes
#      are written; two nodes that round differently disagree about what the
#      network holds.
#   5. The arithmetic widens to u128 before multiplying. Bytes times a rate
#      times an epoch count leaves u64 for objects a network would hold.
#   6. *Every* rate pair in the module sits on one scale, not just the pinned
#      one. Checking that 403 and 694 appear somewhere says nothing about the
#      other `OperatorRates` literals in the file, and the first version of
#      this gate passed a module whose disagreement test carried the processor
#      rate at 1e9 while its disk rates sat at 1e6. That test then asserted
#      only that two answers differed, so a thousandfold error collapsed both
#      operators onto the same answer and the assertion, not the gate, is what
#      caught it. A rate pair whose two sides are more than a hundredfold
#      apart is a scale error, because real hardware does not differ by that
#      much: rented disk is about ten times owned disk, not a thousand.
