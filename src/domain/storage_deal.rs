//! B.U.D. storage deals and retrieval challenges (
//! Vision §8.5).
//!
//! **Production boundary:** the BudZKVM `VerifyMerkle` 64-depth soundness gate
//! Is still treated as incomplete for mainnet claims. Every `open_deal` requires
//! A structurally valid `ProofEnvelope` plus `storage_root`, and challenge answers
//! Bind that envelope to chain/deal/challenge context, but this module must not
//! Market the result as full Proof-of-Storage until the independent proof gate is
//! Closed.
//!
//! Two availability/proof layers currently coexist:
//!
//! 1. **Merkle envelope binding:** every `open_deal` requires a
//!    `merkle_proof` and `storage_root`; the chain validates envelope shape and
//!    Replay-domain binding. This is a devnet hardening gate, not a mainnet
//!    Durability claim.
//!
//! 2. **Retrieval Challenge:** the interim retrieval challenge remains
//!    As an anti-unresponsiveness mechanism. An operator can pass by holding only
//!    The requested byte range - it does NOT prove full storage. Treat
//!    Slashing-from-missed-challenge as a "this operator is unresponsive" signal,
//!    NOT as a "this operator is destroying provable storage" signal.
//!
//! Data-sovereignty rule (plan §0.5): anyone (any account, no
//! Role required) may open a `RetrievalChallenge` and may submit a
//! `StorageDeal`. There is no team-gated "official monitor" role.

    ///     at `imm` and 64 siblings, plus two seeded registers. A storage root
    ///     is none of those. `bud-cli` had the same mistake and it was fixed
    ///     when the commitment landed; this caller was missed because no test
    ///     ever ran a real proof through it.
    ///   * `event_digest` is given the context digest. The AIR builds that
    ///     field by summing the `rs1` of every `Log` row and this program has
    ///     no `Log`, so the only value it accepts is zero.

    /// Correcting those three is not enough, which is why this is a flag and
    /// not a patch. To state the initial-image commitment the verifier needs
    /// the 65 path words and the two seeded registers, and it holds none of
    /// them: `answer_challenge` receives a `storage_root` and a `range_hash`,
    /// and the `merkle_proof` stored on the deal is a `ProofEnvelope`, not the
    /// `[leaf || siblings || path_bits]` its comment describes. Beyond that,
