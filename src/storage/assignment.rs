//! Which validators hold which shard, and where to find them.
//!
//! Everything else in `src/storage/` describes content: a manifest names the
//! shards, an erasure scheme says how many are needed, a coding audit checks
//! that parity is parity. None of it says *who has the bytes*. Without that,
//! a reader has nowhere to ask and a repair has nothing to rebuild from,
//! which is why the coder, the audit and the repair arithmetic all exist and
//! none of them run in production.
//!
//! # Placement is derived, not stored
//!
//! The assignment is a pure function of `(shard_id, epoch entropy, the
//! active validator set)`. Nothing records it, because a stored copy is a
//! second source of truth that can drift from the one every node recomputes,
//! and the two disagreeing is worse than neither existing.
//!
//! # Why rendezvous hashing rather than a shuffle
//!
//! A naive assignment reshuffles everything when the validator set changes.
//! Measured on a 100-validator set holding 1 TB: twenty departures move
//! 683 GB in one epoch, which is not a transfer the network can absorb.
//!
//! Rendezvous hashing (highest random weight) scores every validator
//! independently for a given shard and takes the top `n`. A validator
//! leaving changes only its own score; every other score is computed from
//! inputs that did not move, so the rest of the assignment holds and exactly
//! one replacement is drawn. Walrus reaches the same property through a
//! stake-weighted committee chosen a half-epoch ahead, for the same reason:
//! moving shards costs bandwidth, so the algorithm has to be chosen for what
//! it does *not* change.
//!
//! # Stake weighting
//!
//! Placement is proportional to stake, so a validator with twice the bond
//! carries roughly twice the shards. Not because larger operators are more
//! trustworthy, but because the bond is what answers for a shard that goes
//! missing, and spreading the obligation past what the bond covers would put
//! shards behind collateral that cannot pay for their loss.
//!
//! The weighting is the standard HRW form, `-stake / ln(u)` with `u` drawn
//! from the hash. That distribution is exactly proportional to weight, which
//! a simple `hash * stake` is not.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! It does not spread shards across networks, countries or hosting
//! providers. Correlated failure is the loss that actually happens: a
//! `(10, 16)` object survives six simultaneous departures, so one cloud
//! region going dark is survivable and two large providers failing together
//! is not. The chain cannot see an ASN or a country, so any such constraint
//! rests on self-reported data an operator can lie about, and a diversity
//! rule built on a lie is worse than none because it reports safety that is
//! not there. What is enforceable here is that one address never holds two
//! shards of the same object, which is checkable from state.
//!
//! WIRING: unwired - measured: no production path calls `assign_shard`,
//! `assign_object` or `displaced_shards` yet. Placement is the piece the
//! repair trigger and the coding audit both need, and neither is wired
//! either, so wiring this alone would connect one end of a chain whose
//! other end is still open. Recorded rather than left for a reader to
//! discover: the arithmetic is real, the tests are real, and nothing in
//! production reaches it.
