//! Which storage strategy an object deserves *today*.
//!
//! [`crate::storage::derived`] and [`crate::storage::generated`] each remove
//! bytes by keeping a description instead. Both are worth it below some
//! request rate and not above it, and the crossing point is one division.
//!
//! What this module adds is that the crossing point does not move but the
//! object does. Access to a stored object decays with age, so the same object
//! sits on different sides of the same threshold at different times. A
//! strategy chosen once at upload is therefore wrong for most of the object's
//! life, in whichever direction it was wrong to begin with.
//!
//! # Three numbers, three thresholds
//!
//! The break-even request rate for a lever that shrinks an object to `m` of
//! its size, at `cpu_nanos_per_byte` to reproduce:
//!
//! ```text
//! r* = (1 - m) * disk_rate / (cpu_nanos_per_byte * cpu_rate)
//! ```
//!
//! Measured on the rates this project already uses (0.29 $/TB/month owned
//! disk, 0.0025 $/hour of processor):
//!
//! | lever | m | r* (reads/month) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | lossless JPEG recompression | 0.773 | 1.4 |
//! | derived region of a master | 0 | 20.9 |
//! | described content | 0 | 418 |
//!
//! Three levers, three thresholds, three orders of magnitude apart. A single
//! hot/cold split cannot express that: an object read fifty times a month is
//! cold for one lever and hot for the other two.
//!
//! # Why the counter has to be an estimate
//!
//! Counting reads exactly would mean writing on every read, which is the cost
//! the levers exist to avoid. This keeps a decaying estimate instead: each
//! read adds one, and the accumulated value halves every
//! [`ACCESS_HALF_LIFE_EPOCHS`]. That is a single multiply on read and needs no
//! history, and it answers the only question being asked, which is the current
//! rate rather than the total.
//!
//! # Why moving costs something
//!
//! Changing strategy is work: bytes are dropped or recomputed once. A rate
//! hovering at the threshold would otherwise flip every epoch and pay that
//! cost repeatedly, which is how a saving turns into a loss without anything
//! looking wrong. Two things prevent it. The transition cost is charged
//! against the projected saving before a move is allowed, and the thresholds
//! carry hysteresis, so leaving a strategy needs a rate meaningfully past the
//! one that entered it.
//!
//! # What was measured, and what it ruled out
//!
//! Proving a generator's output with the repository's own STARK stack was
//! costed rather than assumed. `draw_gradient` spends about 72 VM steps per
//! pixel; the trace is `TRACE_WIDTH = 745` columns and `3n+1` rows rounded up
//! to a power of two. A 3 KB avatar is 1,024 pixels, so 73,728 steps, so
//! 262,144 rows, so 195 million trace cells. Against a published Plonky3
//! Goldilocks measurement of 2,633 x 32,768 cells in 1.51 s, that is 3.4
//! seconds of proving, which at the rates above buys about 2,664 months of
//! storing the same object.
//!
//! So a proof per object is not on the table, and this module does not offer
//! it. What it offers is the cheap check that was available all along:
//! `manifest_id` is the hash of the bytes, so recomputing and hashing is a
//! complete verification, and it costs the same as the reproduction the reader
//! was going to do anyway. The proving route stays interesting for the case
//! where a *verifier* must be convinced without reproducing, and that case is
//! not this one.
//!
//! # What is wired and what is not
//!
//! The arithmetic, its bounds and its refusals are here, tested, and exported
//! from [`crate::storage`]. What no production path does yet is *consult* a
//! strategy for a real object, because that needs an access estimate carried
//! in the manifest, which is a consensus-surface change and lands separately.
//! So the decision function is reachable and the decision is not yet taken.
//!
//! WIRING: unwired - measured. [`AccessEstimate`] appears in exactly two
//! places outside this file, both of them the re-export in
//! `crate::storage`; nothing constructs one.
//! [`ContentManifest`](crate::storage::manifest::ContentManifest) carries no
//! access counter and no strategy field, so there is nowhere to put the two
//! values [`decide`] needs as input and nowhere to record the answer it
//! returns.
//!
//! Both halves of that are the same consensus-surface change and neither can
//! be done alone. An estimate every node has to agree on cannot live on one
//! node, because two nodes holding different counts would decide differently
//! about the same object and the network would stop agreeing on what it
//! holds. The counter has to be a manifest field updated under the same
//! rules as the rest of the manifest, which means a new field in a
//! content-addressed structure, which means deciding whether it is part of
//! the identity: fold it in and every read changes the content id, leave it
//! out and it is state the id does not bind.
//!
//! The arithmetic is finished and does not depend on how that is answered,
//! which is why it is here and correct while nothing calls it.
