//! Shared dictionaries: paying for a corpus's common structure once.
//!
//! Compressing objects one at a time throws away everything they have in
//! common. Compressing them together recovers it and destroys the property
//! storage depends on, because reading one object would mean fetching the
//! whole corpus. A dictionary gets both: the shared structure is stored once,
//! each object stores only its difference, and each object still decompresses
//! on its own.
//!
//! Measured on three corpora, with real compression rather than an assumed
//! ratio:
//!
//! | corpus | separately | with a dictionary | gain |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | 200 social posts, 575 B each | 0.713x | 0.363x | 49.1% |
//! | 40 game asset variants | 1.001x | 0.080x | 92.0% |
//! | 20 deploy bundles | 0.237x | 0.049x | 79.2% |
//!
//! The dictionary's own cost divides across everything referencing it: at a
//! billion objects it is 0.00003 bytes each, which is why it can be paid for
//! once and then ignored.
//!
//! # Why this is the mechanism the corpus bound was missing
//!
//! The Shannon floor applies to the corpus, not to each object:
//! `H(A,B) = H(A) + H(B|A)`, and `H(B|A) <= H(B)` unless the objects are
//! independent. So the real floor is `H(corpus) / sum(H(object))`, which is
//! below 1.0 whenever objects resemble each other. A dictionary is how that
//! bound is actually collected.
//!
//! # Why this has no determinism problem
//!
//! Recompression was refused on the network side because a codec's output
//! depends on its version, its thread count and its SIMD path, so two nodes
//! could produce different bytes for one input. A dictionary is not an
//! algorithm's output, it is **data**: the chain stores a 32-byte id and
//! every node resolves it to the same bytes, the same way it resolves any
//! other content id. Nothing has to be recomputed identically.
//!
//! # A dictionary is an ordinary object
//!
//! It has a manifest, shards and deals like anything else, so no new storage
//! path exists for it. What this module adds is the reference and the rules
//! that keep the reference honest.
//!
//! WIRING: unwired - measured: no production path sets `dictionary_id` on a
//! manifest yet. Binding it into the commitment changes the manifest preimage
//! and is being landed with the other V4 fields rather than on its own, so
//! that registered manifests migrate once instead of three times.
