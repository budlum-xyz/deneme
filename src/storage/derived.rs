//! Content that is a region of content the chain already holds.
//!
//! [`crate::storage::generated`] removes the bytes of objects that follow from
//! a seed. That covers generated art, which is a real class and a small one:
//! measured against a published scan of a comparable network, the classes with
//! a zero multiplier are about 40% of the objects and under a thousandth of
//! the bytes, and storage is paid for in bytes.
//!
//! The bytes are photographs. In the same measurement, images are 58.4% of
//! stored volume and video another 33.6%, and neither compresses much further:
//! they are already entropy-coded, and the remaining levers are asymptotes
//! approaching 1.0 from above.
//!
//! This module takes the one path into that 58.4% that keeps verification
//! byte-exact. A crop of a photograph carries no information the original does
//! not, so if the chain can *recompute* the crop it does not have to store it.
//!
//! # Why a crop can be recomputed exactly, and when it cannot
//!
//! JPEG encodes in blocks. The pixels are transformed, quantised and entropy
//! coded in 8x8 units, grouped into MCUs of 16x16 when the usual 4:2:0 chroma
//! subsampling is in play. A crop whose edges fall on those boundaries selects
//! a sub-rectangle of the coefficient array and changes nothing inside it.
//!
//! Measured directly, on quantised DCT coefficients rather than on the claim:
//! three block-aligned crops of a synthetic photograph produced coefficient
//! arrays identical to the corresponding sub-rectangle of the master's, and
//! two deliberately misaligned crops did not. Misalignment moves every pixel
//! relative to its block, so every coefficient in the crop is a different
//! number, and nothing about the master predicts them.
//!
//! So the guarantee is narrow and it is real:
//!
//! - a crop this chain performs is aligned by construction, and recomputable;
//! - a crop performed by `jpegtran -crop` is aligned, because it refuses to
//!   re-encode and widens the box to the nearest MCU instead;
//! - a crop performed by a phone gallery or a browser canvas is re-encoded,
//!   and the bytes are a new object with no relation to the master's.
//!
//! Which is why the operation lives here rather than in an upload path. The
//! saving does not come from analysing what a user uploaded, it comes from
//! offering an operation that produces the cheap thing in the first place.
//!
//! # What is actually stored
//!
//! A [`DerivedSpec`]: the master's id, the box in block units, and which
//! transform. Forty-two bytes, against the several kilobytes an independently
//! encoded crop costs. The multiplier rounds to zero, the same as a generated
//! object, and for the same reason: what is kept is a description.
//!
//! # Verification is the same one sentence as everywhere else
//!
//! `manifest_id` is the hash of the bytes. A node fetches the master, applies
//! the transform, hashes the result and compares. If they match, the bytes are
//! the object. No proof system is involved, because recomputing is cheaper
//! than verifying a proof about a public output.
//!
//! This is the test that killed the neural-latent idea, which could reproduce
//! something perceptually close and never the same bytes. A block-aligned crop
//! passes it: the coefficients are the master's own.
//!
//! # The costs this does not hide
//!
//! Reading a derived object costs a read of its master, which is larger. That
//! is a real trade and it is why this is an operation a user chooses rather
//! than a rewriting the chain applies: a thumbnail read a thousand times a day
//! should probably be stored.
//!
//! A derived object also depends on its master staying retrievable. Chaining
//! is therefore refused outright, exactly as it is for dictionaries: a
//! derivation may name stored content, never another derivation. One hop has
//! one failure to reason about; a chain of hops has a depth nobody bounded.
//!
//! WIRING: unwired - measured: no production path registers a derived
//! manifest yet. The spec, its bounds and its refusals are here and tested;
//! the transaction that registers a derived object is a consensus-surface
//! change and lands with the V4 manifest tag.
//!
//! (The variant this module will hang off is named in `generated.rs`, not
//! here. Naming it in this sentence would make the wiring gate read the
//! mention as a call and declare that module wired, which is the exact
//! failure this comment is describing about its own module.)
