//! Content that is described rather than stored.
//!
//! Every other saving in `src/storage/` makes the bytes smaller. This one
//! removes them: an object whose bytes follow from a short description does
//! not need the bytes on disk at all, only the description. Measured against
//! the alternatives, it is the only lever that reaches a zero multiplier,
//! and every other lever is an asymptote that approaches 1.0 from above.
//!
//! # Why the chain can trust a generated object
//!
//! `manifest_id` is the hash of the object's bytes. That single fact makes
//! verification trivial here: a node runs the description, hashes what comes
//! out, and compares. If the hashes match, the bytes are the object, by the
//! same definition the chain already uses for stored content. Nothing new has
//! to be believed.
//!
//! This is why generated content needs **no** zero-knowledge proof. A STARK
//! is what you reach for when the output is secret or when recomputing is
//! more expensive than verifying a proof about it. Here the output is public
//! and recomputation is the cheapest check available, so a proof would add
//! cost and prove something already known.
//!
//! # Determinism is the whole requirement
//!
//! Two nodes must produce the same bytes, or they will disagree about whether
//! an object is valid, which is a fork. Floating point cannot give that
//! guarantee across machines, so it is refused, in the same way and for the
//! same reason it is refused everywhere else in consensus code. What replaces
//! it is [`crate::storage::fixed_point`], a small fixed-point library, because refusing floats
//! without offering an alternative just moves the problem into every caller.
//!
//! # A budget, not a ceiling
//!
//! A generator could loop forever, and no check can decide in advance whether
//! it will (Turing). Left alone, that is three separate failures: a reader
//! waits forever, two nodes time out differently and disagree, and an
//! attacker uploads thirty-two bytes to burn minutes of everyone's CPU.
//!
//! The fix is not a fixed step limit, which would say "content above this
//! complexity may not exist" and is a restriction on expression. It is a
//! **budget the uploader pays for**: steps are metered, the budget is
//! declared in the manifest and priced like any other resource, and a
//! generator that exhausts it stops. Expensive content is not refused, it is
//! pointed at the storage path instead, which already works. The ceiling is
//! a fork in the road rather than a wall.
//!
//! # What a challenge over described content proves
//!
//! Worth stating before anything is built on top of it, because it decides
//! what the storage market is selling here.
//!
//! The recipe is in the manifest, so it is on chain, so everyone has it. A
//! challenger asking an operator to produce bytes already holds every input
//! needed to produce them itself. The operator has nothing the challenger
//! lacks.
//!
//! So a challenge answered from a `Generated` source is not a proof of
//! storage. It is a proof of computation, performed on demand, and three
//! things follow that do not follow for `Stored` content:
//!
//! * What is being paid for is availability of compute, not custody of
//!   bytes. There is no object to lose.
//! * A slash cannot mean "you lost the data", because there is no data to
//!   lose. It can only mean "you did not answer", which is a different fault
//!   with a different burden: being briefly offline and having destroyed an
//!   object are the same observation here and are not the same thing.
//! * Replication does not apply. Three copies of stored bytes protect against
//!   three failures; there are no copies of a recipe beyond the one the chain
//!   already holds, so shard placement and repair traffic have nothing to act
//!   on.
//!
//! None of that weakens the saving, which is real and total: nothing is
//! stored. It does mean the deal, the penalty and the redundancy model for
//! described content are separate questions from the ones `Stored` content
//! answers, and answering them by analogy would get all three wrong.
//!
//! `Hybrid` sits between the two and inherits both halves: the prefix is
//! custody and can be lost, the remainder is compute and cannot.
//!
//! `render.rs` now calls the generators to produce on-demand bytes, so this
//! module is wired. What is still missing is the transaction that registers a
//! described object as a `ContentSource::Generated` manifest, which is a
//! consensus-surface change of its own.
