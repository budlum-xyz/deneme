//! Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) repair cost, as pure arithmetic.
//!
//! WIRING: unwired - this module measures the repair-traffic floor for the
//! storage research; the consensus surface that will price repair from it
//! (validator-facing accounting, Layer 3) is not built yet, so the module is
//! reached by its own tests and by `lrc.rs` only.
//!
//! A repair that must read every surviving data shard costs `k` shards of
//! traffic no matter how the parity is laid out. Regenerating codes lower
//! that by trading compute for bandwidth: a node that loses one shard reads
//! `d` of the remaining shards and *regenerates* the lost one from their
//! contents, and the information-theoretic floor on that traffic (the
//! cut-set bound) is
//!
//! ```text
//!   repair bandwidth  >=  d / (d - k + 1)   shard-equivalents
//! ```
//!
//! For the measured layout in the storage research, `k = 20, d = 25`:
//! `25 / 6 ~= 4.17` shard-equivalents, against `k / L = 20` for a plain RS
//! group and `40` for an LRC at `k = 2000` (the 4.8x figure). The bound is
//! reached by MSR codes (Rashmi et al.), so this module measures the cost a
//! correct MSR implementation would meet, without depending on one.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The storage research closes with "MSR onarımı hesaplayarak trafiği
//! düşürüyor - fikrinizin 'üretim maliyetli olsun ama depolama sorun olmasın'
//! mantığının matematiksel karşılığı." This is that claim as a checkable
//! integer: given a repair degree, what is the traffic floor, and how does
//! it compare to the LRC the tree already has?
//!
//! Integer only. A repair cost that differed in its last bit between
//! machines would make two nodes disagree about how much a repair is
//! allowed to read, so the fraction is carried scaled by [`TRAFFIC_SCALE`],
//! exactly like `LrcLayout::lrc_overhead_per_mille` carries overhead.
