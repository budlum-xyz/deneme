//! Fixed-point arithmetic for content generators.
//!
//! Floating point is refused in consensus code because two machines can
//! disagree on the last bit, and a generator that disagrees produces a
//! different object on different nodes, which is a fork. Integers do not have
//! that problem, so this is the arithmetic generators are given instead.
//!
//! Refusing floats without offering a replacement would only move the problem
//! into every caller, which is why this exists rather than a lint.
//!
//! The scale is a power of two so multiplication and division reduce to
//! shifts, keeping the rounding exact rather than merely consistent.
//!
//! Kept in its own file because the gate that measures whether a module is
//! wired counts name matches across the tree, and `mul`, `div` and `sqrt`
//! appear in prose in the prover and the VM. Names here carry a `fixed_`
//! prefix for the same reason: a measurement that cannot tell two modules
//! apart reports the wrong one as dead.
