//! Reed-Solomon coder over GF(2^8) - the thing that actually computes parity.
//!
//! `src/storage/manifest.rs` already describes redundancy: a
//! [`crate::storage::manifest::ErasureScheme`] says "any `k` of these `n`
//! shards reconstruct the object" and [`crate::storage::manifest::ShardRef`]
//! says which shards are `Data` and which are `Parity`. Nothing computed
//! those parity bytes, so the description was a promise the code could not
//! keep: a manifest could declare `(k=4, n=6)`, a repair trigger could read
//! that and conclude two losses were survivable, and no one could actually
//! rebuild the object. This module closes that.
//!
//! # Why a coder in-tree rather than a dependency
//!
//! `reed-solomon-erasure` is the crate everyone reaches for, and it is the
//! one `docs/BUD_STORAGE_ROADMAP.md` named. It is unmaintained, the owner
//! stopped in 2021 and asked for a new owner
//! (darrenldl/reed-solomon-erasure#88); Solana, its largest user, moved off
//! it. `reed-solomon-simd` is maintained but its speed comes from
//! target-specific `unsafe`, and `src/lib.rs` is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
//! Neither is acceptable, and vendoring is not on the table. The code below
//! is a few hundred lines of table-driven finite-field arithmetic with no
//! dependencies and no `unsafe`.
//!
//! # The construction
//!
//! Encoding is a matrix product over GF(2^8). The generator is systematic:
//! an identity block on top, so data shards pass through byte-for-byte, and
//! a Cauchy block underneath that produces the parity shards.
//!
//! ```text
//!   [ I_k    ]           [ data_0 ]     [ data_0   ]
//!   [        ]  x  ...   [  ...   ]  =  [ ...      ]
//!   [ C(m,k) ]           [ data_k ]     [ parity_0 ]
//! ```
//!
//! The Cauchy block is `C[i][j] = 1 / (x_i + y_j)` with the `x` and `y` sets
//! disjoint, which makes *every* square submatrix invertible. That property
//! is exactly the MDS condition: `[I | C^T]` generates a systematic MDS code
//! iff every square submatrix of `C` is invertible (Blomer et al., "An XOR-
//! based erasure-resilient coding scheme", Theorem 2.2). MDS is what lets
//! reconstruction use *whichever* `k` shards survived rather than a
//! privileged subset - a Vandermonde block does not give this for free,
//! because a Vandermonde matrix over a finite field can have singular
//! submatrices even when the full matrix is invertible.
//!
//! Decoding inverts the `k x k` submatrix formed by the surviving shards'
//! rows and multiplies the survivors through it. Since every square
//! submatrix is invertible, that inverse always exists for any `k`
//! survivors, so recovery never depends on *which* ones were lost.
//!
//! # Field
//!
//! GF(2^8) modulo 0x11D, the same primitive polynomial as Intel ISA-L,
//! Backblaze, and the Reed-Solomon in QR codes. Multiplication goes through
//! log/exp tables built once at first use; inversion is `exp[255 - log[a]]`.
//! `n <= 255` follows from the field: the Cauchy construction needs `k + m`
//! distinct non-zero-difference field elements.
