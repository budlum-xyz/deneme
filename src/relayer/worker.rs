/// Universal Relayer Worker.

/// relays them to external chains (EVM, Solana, etc.).
///
/// # What this worker is allowed to assert
///
/// A `RelayerResult` transaction is a *claim about another chain*. Budlum's
/// consensus can only check that claim against a finalized light-client
/// anchor, so the worker must never manufacture one. Concretely:
///
/// - the external transaction hash comes from an adapter that actually
///   broadcast it, never from a constant;
/// - the receipt proof comes from an adapter that read the external chain,
///   never from a locally invented single-leaf tree;
/// - the adapter re-verifies its own proof (`verify_receipt_proof`) before
///   the result is signed, so a broken or dishonest adapter is caught here
///   rather than by consensus after the signature exists.
///
/// If any of those cannot be satisfied, the worker submits nothing. A relayer
/// that stays silent stalls a transfer; a relayer that signs an unverified
/// success is indistinguishable from an attacker, because the signature makes
/// the lie authentic. That asymmetry is why every failure path below is a
/// refusal and not a fallback.
