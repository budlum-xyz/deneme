//! Slashing evidence format shared across the whole node.
//!
//! This is the single, canonical shape in which a proven offence is reported to
//! The [`PermissionlessRegistry`](super::permissionless::PermissionlessRegistry).
//! The consensus layer produces it, the RPC `slash-evidence-submit` endpoint
//! Accepts it, and future domains reuse it verbatim, so the format lives here,
//! Not in any one producer.
//!
//! ## Design
//! An evidence item says: *"account `offender`, acting in `role`, committed
//! `condition`, and here is the proof."* The proof is carried as an opaque,
//! Condition-specific `proof` payload plus a `verified` provenance flag.
//!
//! Verification is intentionally layered:
//! - Structural validation ([`SlashingReport::validate_shape`]) is
//!   Domain-agnostic and always runs.
//! - Cryptographic/consensus validation is done by the *producer* that has the
//!   Context to do it (e.g. `PoSEngine::verify_evidence` checks the two block
//!   Headers' signatures) which then sets [`ProofProvenance::ConsensusVerified`].
//!   The registry only applies a slash for reports whose provenance it trusts,
//!   So it never has to understand every consensus flavour.
//!
//! ## The permissionless route
//!
//! `bud_submitSlashingReport` accepts a report from anybody. The RPC layer
//! overwrites the caller's claimed provenance with
//! [`ProofProvenance::Unverified`], because a submitter that could certify
//! its own report could slash any validator it liked.
//!
//! That left a question the code answered badly for a while: an `Unverified`
//! report is refused by [`SlashingReport::is_actionable`], and the refusal
//! took the path that burns the anti-spam fee. The endpoint charged for every
//! submission and could act on none of them, so a reporter holding genuine
//! proof of an equivocation paid to be ignored, which is the opposite of the
//! incentive a permissionless reporting channel needs.
//!
//! `SlashingReport::verify_double_sign` (test-only since the Strix CWE-347 fix) is the answer. A double-sign proof
//! does not need a trusted sender: it carries two signatures by the offender
//! over two different block hashes at one height, and only the offender's key
//! can produce that pair. The chain checks the pair itself, before charging
//! anything, and promotes the report to [`ProofProvenance::ConsensusVerified`]
//! on the strength of the cryptography.
//!
//! The other conditions have no such self-contained proof. Liveness is a
//! claim about what did not happen and invalid-relay conditions are claims
//! about execution, so both need the context only consensus holds. Reports of
//! those still arrive through the consensus path, and the RPC route refuses
//! them rather than pretending it verified something.
