//! Every path that moves value without consensus is named here, and refuses
//! on mainnet.
//!
//! B38. Two methods on `ChainHandle` credited accounts with no signature, no
//! nonce, no proof and no supply accounting:
//!
//! ```text
//! ChainHandle::add_balance(addr, amount)   -> state.add_balance, saturating
//! ChainHandle::init_genesis_account(addr)  -> balance = GENESIS_BALANCE (1e9)
//! ```
//!
//! The second is the worse of the two, and its name is why it survived
//! review. "init_genesis_account" describes a moment in the chain's life, and
//! the body checked nothing about that moment: no height, no network, no
//! genesis flag. Measured against the body as it stood:
//!
//! ```text
//! height          0  -> 1,000,000,000
//! height 10,000,000  -> 1,000,000,000
//! spend down to 5, call again -> 1,000,000,000
//! ```
//!
//! It does not stack on a single address, so it is not a mint loop. It is an
//! unlimited refill: any address returns to 1e9 as often as it is drained, and
//! a fresh address arrives already funded. `BUD_TOTAL_SUPPLY` is 1e14, so
//! about a hundred thousand calls exceed the entire supply, while
//! `nonzero_block_reward_config_cannot_mint` and its neighbours go on
//! asserting that no path can mint.
//!
//! Nothing in production called either one. That is the same shape as B27:
//! the hazard is not what runs today, it is what the next person wires up
//! after reading a name that promises genesis and a signature that accepts
//! any address at any height.
//!
//! They are gated rather than deleted, because devnet and the RPC tests do
//! need funded accounts. The gate is the chain id, matching
//! `mainnet_requires_signed_remote_snapshot`, which is how this tree already
//! asks the question.
