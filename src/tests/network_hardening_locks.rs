//! Locks for network-layer hardening that is easy to undo by accident.
//!
//! Two classes of finding live here:
//!
//!   * A poisoned mutex must degrade the affected request, not kill the node.
//!     `src/network/node.rs` holds ~20 lock sites; all but one already matched
//!     on the result or exited deliberately, and the odd one out turned an
//!     optional content fetch into a node-wide panic.
//!   * `Gossipsub`'s defaults are the network's DoS surface. They are currently
//!     accepted deliberately, and this file records which ones were checked so
//!     "we never looked" cannot be confused with "we looked and accepted".
