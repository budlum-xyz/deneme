//! Locks the resolved versions of dependencies that used to carry advisories.
//!
//! Three advisories were carried for weeks as "unreachable" exceptions:
//!
//!   * GHSA-vxx9-2994-q338 — yamux remote panic (CVSS 8.7)
//!   * GHSA-3v94-mw7p-v465 / RUSTSEC-2026-0118 — hickory NSEC3 validation loop
//!   * GHSA-q2qq-hmj6-3wpp — hickory O(n²) message encoding
//!
//! Each exception rested on a fact a routine dependency change could silently
//! flip (the muxer picking the patched backend, DNSSEC not being compiled in,
//! the node never serving DNS). None of that is needed any more: libp2p 0.56
//! pinned the vulnerable versions, and pinning the 0.57.0 tree moves the graph
//! to yamux 0.14.0 and hickory 0.26.1, so the findings are **fixed** rather
//! than argued away.
//!
//! These tests now guard the fix instead of the excuse. They fail if the graph
//! slides back to a vulnerable version, and they fail if the scanner ignore
//! lists grow the old entries back.
