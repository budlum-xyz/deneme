//! Two findings closed alongside the Reed-Solomon coder, both of which were
//! invisible while replication was the only redundancy scheme:
//!
//! 1. `manifest_id` arrived from an RPC caller and nothing recomputed it, so a
//!    caller could register content under any id it chose.
//! 2. The commitment covered `(index, shard_id, size)` and not `kind` or
//!    `erasure`, so two manifests could share an id and disagree about how
