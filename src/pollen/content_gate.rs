//! The bridge between a Pollen data asset and the bytes behind it.
//!
//! Pollen governs *permission*: a `DataAsset` is registered, an `AccessGrant`
//! is issued against a payment, and `validate_ai_read_ref` refuses an AI
//! request whose grant is missing, expired, exhausted or held by someone
//! else. B.U.D. governs *bytes*: a `ContentManifest` names shards, operators
//! hold them, and a reader assembles `k` of them into the object.
//!
//! Those two were complete on their own and had no connection, which is the
//! hole this module closes. Measured: nothing in `src/storage/` mentions
//! Pollen, and nothing in `src/pollen/` mentions a manifest. So the same
//! bytes could be sold through Pollen and simultaneously be fetched from
//! B.U.D. by anyone who knew the `manifest_id`, and the second path asked no
//! questions. Paying was optional in the only sense that matters.
//!
//! # What this adds
//!
//! One registry, `ProtectedContent`, mapping `manifest_id -> asset_id`. Once
//! a manifest is bound to an asset:
//!
//! * reading it requires a live grant, checked through Pollen's own
//!   `validate_ai_read_ref` rules rather than a second copy of them;
//! * it can never be declared public, so the deduplication path cannot see
//!   it. That matters more than it looks: deduplication keys on content, so
//!   an attacker who can guess an asset's contents could confirm its
//!   existence, or brute-force a missing field, without ever buying it.
//!   Those are the confirmation-of-a-file and learn-the-remaining-information
//!   attacks, and paid content is exactly the target they are written for.
//!
//! # Why the binding is one-way
//!
//! A manifest can be bound to an asset. It can never be unbound. Unbinding
//! would let an owner take payment, then release the bytes into the public
//! path where they are free and deduplicated, which is the same as not
//! having sold anything. Content that should stop being protected is
//! withdrawn by revoking the `DataAsset`, which stops new grants and leaves
//! the binding intact.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not do
//!
//! It does not encrypt anything and does not hold keys. An operator holding
//! a shard still holds those bytes; what changes is whether the chain will
//! *authorise* a read and let an AI request consume it. Byte-level secrecy
//! is the client-side encryption layer's job, and the two compose: encrypted
//! content plus a grant means the operator holds ciphertext and the chain
//! decides who may ask for it.
