//! What a Lubot model is allowed to read, and in what form.
//!
//! Lubot already answers "may this operator touch this data" through Pollen.
//! This module answers the question underneath it: **what kind of reading is
//! being asked for.** Text and an image are not the same request even when
//! the grant is identical, because they cost different amounts, they fail in
//! different ways, and one of them can be made deterministic while the other
//! cannot.
//!
//! # Reading only
//!
//! Lubot does not generate images or video, and nothing here opens a door to
//! it. Every variant of `PerceptionKind` below describes an input a model may
//! consume. That is a scope decision rather than a technical limit: a
//! generation surface would need its own economics, its own abuse model and
//! its own answer to "who owns the output", and none of those are settled.
//! Declaring the boundary in the type keeps a later contributor from adding
//! `ImageOutput` next to `ImageInput` and calling it symmetry.
//!
//! # Why a declaration rather than sniffing the bytes
//!
//! The alternative is to look at the content and decide. That fails on this
//! chain for a specific reason: a `ContentId` is the hash of the object, and
//! the object may be ciphertext the chain never sees. There is nothing to
//! sniff. The reader therefore states what it intends to read, the statement
//! is part of what the request commits to, and a model that was registered
//! for text cannot quietly be handed a video frame.
//!
//! # The budget is per modality, and that is the point
//!
//! A thousand tokens of text and a thousand pixels of image are not
//! comparable work. Charging them the same rate either overprices text or
//! underprices images, and underpricing an input is how a cheap request
//! becomes an expensive one for whoever runs the operator. Each modality
//! carries its own ceiling, expressed in its own unit.
//!
//! WIRING: wired - `PerceptionRequest` is constructed on the RPC surface
//! (`bud_aiSubmitRequest`) and the wire format, carried in
//! `AiInferenceRequest::perception`, and refused or admitted by
//! `lubot::admit_inference_request` on both executor paths.
