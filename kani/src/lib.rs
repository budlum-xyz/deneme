//! Bond arithmetic under model checking.
//!
//! `SECURITY.md` listed Kani as open work and named the targets: signature
//! verification, bond arithmetic and Merkle paths. Bond arithmetic is the one
//! that is bounded, self-contained and decides how much stake a validator
//! loses, so it is first.
//!
//! # Why this lives outside `budlum-core`
//!
//! Kani ships a pinned nightly. Version 0.67.0 - the newest published release
//! - bundles rustc 1.93.0-nightly, and `budlum-core` declares
//! `rust-version = "1.94.0"`, so cargo refuses the build before a harness
//! runs. The upstream toolchain bump is merged but unreleased. Lowering the
//! crate's MSRV to suit a verification tool would weaken a promise made to
//! operators in order to make a check pass, so the harnesses live in a
//! standalone package instead.
//!
//! # Why a mirror is sound here
//!
//! [`penalty_for`] is the expression from
//! `PermissionlessRegistry::slash_role_only`, character for character. It is
//! not called through the registry because that needs a populated `BTreeMap`
//! of registrations, which a bit-precise model checker would have to unroll,
//! the arithmetic is what is under proof, not the map.
//!
//! A copy can rot. Two things stop it: `budlum-core`'s
//! `bond_arithmetic_matches_the_kani_mirror` recomputes both and fails on any
//! divergence, and `scripts/check-kani.sh` fails if the number of harnesses
//! Kani ran drops below the number declared here.

    // The quotient is clamped to `stake` instead of being unwrapped into a

    // The previous form was `try_from(...).expect(...)`, which asserted the
    // quotient always fits. It does not. At `stake = u64::MAX` and any ratio
    // above `FIXED_POINT_SCALE` the quotient exceeds `u64::MAX`, so the mirror
    // panicked while production, which spelled the same expression with
    // `as u64`, wrapped instead: `ratio = FIXED_POINT_SCALE + 1` turned a
    // 100.0001% slash into one that left 99.9999% of the bond standing. The
    // two copies did not agree, and the mirror test compared them only over
    // ratios at or below the ceiling, where they do. See B35.
    //
    // Clamping is also what makes the bound provable. Measured against the
    // same class of bitvector query Kani issues, negating `penalty <= stake`:
    //
    //     symbolic udiv, 128 bit       TIMEOUT at 120s
    //     symbolic product, no divide  TIMEOUT at  45s

    //     clamped form                 PROVED  in 0.37s
    //
    // Both terms are walls, not only the divide. The plan recorded earlier,
    // restating the division as a shift/multiply-high pair, would have removed
    // one wall and left the other: `sym * sym` with no divide at all still
    // times out. Clamping moves the property off the arithmetic. `penalty
    // <= stake` is now a fact about a `min`, and holds with no precondition on
    // the ratio, which is the point: it does not depend on governance having
    // validated anything.

// MEASURED, 2026-08-01: every harness that calls `penalty_for` times out.
//
// Six rewrites went into `an_unbounded_ratio_would_overshoot_the_bond` on the
// theory that its multiplications were the problem. They were not. Timing each
// harness separately in an isolated repo, with a three-minute cap each:
//
//     penalty_is_monotonic_for_full_stakes   TIMEOUT
//     penalty_never_exceeds_stake            TIMEOUT
//     remaining_stake_is_exact               TIMEOUT
//     ratio_endpoints_are_exact              TIMEOUT
//     penalty_is_monotonic_in_the_ratio      TIMEOUT
//     a_double_ratio_overshoots                   1s
//     an_unbounded_ratio_can_strictly_exceed_the_bond  0s
//
// The split is exact: the two that finish are the two that do not call
// `penalty_for`. Stake width does not explain it -
// `penalty_is_monotonic_in_the_ratio` was already narrowed to u16 symbols and
// still times out. Multiplication count does not explain it either.
//
// What `penalty_for` had that nothing else here has is a **symbolic division**:
// `(u128 * u128) / u128`. A solver handles a symbolic multiply by summing
// partial products; a symbolic divide it must encode as a search for a
// quotient and remainder satisfying `n = q*d + r, r < d`, over 128-bit terms.
// That reading named a real cost, and it was still the wrong conclusion.
//
// MEASURED AGAIN, 2026-08-01, second pass. The plan recorded above was to
// restate the division as a shift/multiply-high pair. Before writing it, the
// same class of query was put to a bitvector solver directly, negating
// `penalty <= stake`, with the divide present and removed:
//
//     sym * sym, then divide          TIMEOUT   (penalty_for as written)
//     sym * sym, no divide at all     TIMEOUT
//     sym * const, then divide        TIMEOUT
//     sym * const, no divide          PROVED in 0.02s
//     multiply-high reciprocal        TIMEOUT   (the recorded plan)
//
// The recorded plan does not work. Removing the divide is not sufficient
// because the 128-bit **symbolic product** is a wall on its own: three of the
// four cells time out, and the only affordable one is the cell with neither a
// symbolic product nor a divide. A width sweep puts the cliff between u16 and
// u24 operands, far below the u64 the property needs.
//
// So the expression cannot be rewritten into something a solver closes while
// it still multiplies two symbols. The bound is made structural instead:
// `penalty_for` clamps to `stake`. The clamped form is PROVED in 0.37s, and
// in 13.6s even with the ratio precondition dropped entirely.
//
// What that costs, stated plainly: `penalty <= stake` is no longer evidence
// that the division cannot overshoot. It is evidence that an overshoot cannot
// reach the ledger. The overshoot harnesses below keep asking the first
// question by calling `raw_quotient`, so the clamp cannot turn them vacuous.
//
// MEASURED IN CI, per harness, each in its own job with its own cap:
//
//     penalty_never_exceeds_stake                       1s   was TIMEOUT
//     remaining_stake_is_exact                          6s   was TIMEOUT
//     the_clamp_catches_the_quotient_that_used_to_wrap  1s   new
//     no_ratio_can_make_the_penalty_exceed_the_bond     1s   new
//     an_unbounded_ratio_would_overshoot_the_bond       8s   control, unchanged
//     an_unbounded_ratio_overshoots_two_units_above     7s   control, unchanged
//     a_one_and_a_half_times_ratio_overshoots           1s   control, unchanged
//     a_double_ratio_overshoots                         1s   control, unchanged
//     an_unbounded_ratio_can_strictly_exceed_the_bond   1s   control, unchanged
//
// Three are still slow and the clamp does not help them, which is consistent
// rather than surprising:
//
//     ratio_endpoints_are_exact
//     penalty_is_monotonic_in_the_ratio
//     penalty_is_monotonic_for_full_stakes
//
// Each calls `penalty_for` **twice** and relates the two results. The clamp
// bounds a single call against its own input; it says nothing that lets a
// solver compare two independent quotients, so both symbolic products survive
// in the query. Measured: one clamped call is proved in 0.39s, two clamped
// calls related to each other time out at 90s.
//
// Splitting the asserts does not rescue them either, which was the obvious
// next guess and was measured before being believed:
//
//     ratio_endpoints, both asserts together   TIMEOUT
//       split out `ratio == 0` alone           PROVED in 0.00s
//       split out `ratio == SCALE` alone       TIMEOUT
//
// `ratio == 0` collapses the product to zero, so it is free. `ratio == SCALE`
// leaves `stake * 1_000_000` over a symbolic 64-bit stake, which is the same
// wall as everything else here. The pair is not the problem; a symbolic
// product wider than about 24 bits is.
//
// So these three are not CI-budget harnesses, and nothing in this commit
// changes that. What the commit does change is that the property they were
// guarding, `penalty <= stake`, is now proved in a second by a harness that
// does not need them. They are left in place, timing out honestly, rather
// than deleted to make the job green: deleting them would remove the only
// statement in the tree that the truncation is monotonic.
