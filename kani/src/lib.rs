//! Bond arithmetic under model checking.
//!
//! `SECURITY.md` listed Kani as open work and named the targets: signature
//! verification, bond arithmetic and Merkle paths. Bond arithmetic is the one
//! that is bounded, self-contained and decides how much stake a validator
//! loses, so it is first.
//!
//! # Why this lives outside `budlum-core`
//!
//! Kani ships a pinned nightly. Version 0.67.0 — the newest published release
//! — bundles rustc 1.93.0-nightly, and `budlum-core` declares
//! `rust-version = "1.94.0"`, so cargo refuses the build before a harness
//! runs. The upstream toolchain bump is merged but unreleased. Lowering the
//! crate's MSRV to suit a verification tool would weaken a promise made to
//! operators in order to make a check pass, so the harnesses live in a
//! standalone package instead.
//!
//! # Why a mirror is sound here
//!
//! [`penalty_for`] is the expression from
//! `PermissionlessRegistry::slash_role_only`, character for character. It is
//! not called through the registry because that needs a populated `BTreeMap`
//! of registrations, which a bit-precise model checker would have to unroll —
//! the arithmetic is what is under proof, not the map.
//!
//! A copy can rot. Two things stop it: `budlum-core`'s
//! `bond_arithmetic_matches_the_kani_mirror` recomputes both and fails on any
//! divergence, and `scripts/check-kani.sh` fails if the number of harnesses
//! Kani ran drops below the number declared here.

    /// Four asserts written out is the whole fix. A `#[kani::unwind(5)]` would
